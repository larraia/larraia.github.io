## Code samples

My github profile [here](https://github.com/larraia).

* [Large preimage SNARKs](https://github.com/larraia/large_preimages_snarks) _This project provides SNARKs to prove and verify statements on large SHA256 preimages._
* [Multi-key FMD](https://github.com/larraia/multikey-fmd). _Fuzzy Message Detection outsources detection of messages to an untrusted server. This project implements multi-key FMD: several servers are given different detection keys, all extracted from a single secret key._
